This repository shows by using the seqFISH_spatialAnalysis.Rmd and its HTML, how to install the SpatialExperiment R package (please see https://github.com/drighelli/SpatialExperiment) and how 
to use it with seqFISH data provided here https://github.com/BIRSBiointegration/Hackathon/tree/master/seqFISH

Moreover, it stores the provided scRNA-seq data into a SingleCellExperiment class.

For simplicity data have been stored into the data/seqFISH directory.
